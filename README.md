# ETL-by-Python
## Background
* This project is for an international financial analysis company, who tracks stock prices, commodities, forex rates and inflation rates
* Our aim is to extract financial data from various sources like websites, APIs and files provided by various financial analysis firms
* After collecting the data, we'll extract the data of interest to the company and transform it based on the requirements given to us
* Once the transformation is complete, we'll load the data into a database.

## Project Tasks
* Collect data using APIs
* Collect data using webscraping
* Download files to process
* Read csv, XML, and JSON file types
* Extract daata from the above file types
* Transform data
* Use the built in logging module
* Save the transformed data in a ready-to-load format which data engineers/analysts/scientists can use to load the data (eg. into an RDBMS)

## The Python notebook file contains specific tasks such as 
* extracting data from different file formats
* collecting data through APIs and webscraping
* transforming the collected data into a ready-to-load format
